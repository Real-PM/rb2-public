**Effort:** 4-6 hours (actual: ~6 hours)
**Status:** DONE
**Spec Reference:** Lines 220-228, 306-328
**Completed:** 2025-10-09

**Description:**
Display comprehensive yearly batting statistics for position players in tabular format with career totals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Standard batting table displays all specified columns: Year, Age, Team, League, G, PA, AB, R, H, 2B, 3B, HR, RBI, SB, CS, BB, SO, BA, OBP, SLG, OPS, OPS+, TB, GDP, HBP, SH, SF, IBB
- [x] Advanced batting table displays: Year, Age, Team, League, ISO, BABIP, wOBA, wRC, wRC+, wRAA, WPA, UBR, WAR
- [x] Career totals row at bottom (sum of counting stats, calculate rate stats from totals)
- [x] Year column links to Team-Year page (404 for now)
- [x] Team column links to Team detail page
- [x] League column links to League page (404 for now)
- [x] Age calculated correctly for each season
- [x] Numbers formatted correctly (.XXX for AVG, integers for counts)
- [x] Missing values show as '-'
- [x] Table responsive with horizontal scroll on mobile
- [x] First column (Year) is sticky during horizontal scroll
- [x] Retired status displays in player bio when retired=1
- [ ] One row per season (handle mid-season trades by showing combined stats) - DEFERRED

**Bugs Fixed (2025-10-09):**
1. **FIXED: Tables not rendering** - Variables were set AFTER {% include %} instead of before. Moved {% set %} statements before the include in detail.html lines 145-146, 154-155.
2. **FIXED: Missing statistics** - Same root cause as Bug #1. All stats now display correctly.
3. **FIXED: Retired status** - Added conditional check for `player.current_status.retired` in detail.html lines 14-16 with red "Retired" label.
4. **FIXED: SQLAlchemy Row.t conflict** - Used bracket notation `totals_query[6]` instead of `.t` property in player_service.py line 118.
5. **FIXED: Age calculation** - Changed from real-world date (2025) to game year (1997). Updated Player.age property in player.py lines 155-179.
6. **FIXED: Stats sort order** - Changed from descending to ascending (oldest to newest) in player_service.py lines 70, 185.
7. **FIXED: Batting average formatting** - Applied format_stat('avg') filter to show .262 instead of 0.262 in _batting_stats_table.html.
8. **FIXED: Player images not rendering** - Corrected relative path from 4 levels up to 3 levels in players.py line 128.
9. **FIXED: Image cropping** - Changed from 128x128 square to natural 90x135 portrait dimensions in detail.html lines 15, 18.
10. **FIXED: Height display** - Added height_display property to convert cm to feet/inches in player.py lines 193-208.

**Enhancement Added (2025-10-09):**
11. **ADDED: Advanced Batting Statistics Table** - Added separate table below standard stats showing ISO, BABIP, wOBA, wRC, wRC+, wRAA, WPA, UBR, WAR. Moved WAR from standard table to advanced table. All yearly advanced stats pulled directly from database (already calculated in ETL). Career rate stats (ISO, BABIP, wOBA) calculated from totals. Career counting stats (wRC, wRAA, WPA, UBR, WAR) summed via SQL. Values centered in columns.

**Technical Notes:**
- Use SQL aggregation for career totals (performance requirement) ✓ DONE
- Create reusable service layer function: `get_player_career_batting_stats(player_id)` ✓ DONE
- Create Jinja macro/include for reusability: `_batting_stats_table.html` ✓ DONE
- Pitching stats service and template already created during initial implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `/web/app/services/player_service.py` - Created with batting/pitching stats functions, fixed sort order
- `/web/app/templates/players/_batting_stats_table.html` - Created reusable component with proper formatting
- `/web/app/templates/players/_pitching_stats_table.html` - Created reusable component

- [ ] Test with position player (10+ seasons) - NEEDS QA
- [ ] Test with player traded mid-season - NEEDS QA
- [ ] Test with rookie (1 season) - NEEDS QA
- [ ] Test with missing advanced stats (OPS+, WAR) - NEEDS QA

- [ ] Display coach image in header (90x135px like players)
- [ ] JavaScript fallback shows coach initials if image fails to load

**Technical Notes:**
- Reuse player image serving pattern from US-P004
- Same dimensions and fallback logic as player images
- Coach images directory: `etl/data/images/coaches/`

**Files to Modify:**
- `/web/app/routes/coaches.py` - Add coach_image() route
- `/web/app/templates/coaches/detail.html` - Add image display with fallback

**Dependencies:** US-P011 (Coach detail page)

### US-P015: Coach-Player Linkage Display [DONE]
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 2-3 hours (actual: 1 hour)
**Status:** DONE
**Completed:** 2025-10-10
**Spec Reference:** Lines 341-342

**Description:**
When a coach was formerly a player, display the player's image and link to their player page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Check if coach.former_player_id is not null
- [ ] If former player exists, display in top-right corner of header
- [ ] Show most recent player image (90x135px)
- [ ] Link image to player detail page (`/players/<player_id>`)
- [ ] Add label: "Former Player" above/below image
- [ ] Gracefully handle if player record doesn't exist

**Technical Notes:**
- Query player record by former_player_id
- Reuse player image serving route
- Consider showing "View Player Career" link/button
- May want to show player's career stats summary (optional enhancement)

**Files to Modify:**
- `/web/app/routes/coaches.py` - Query former_player record
- `/web/app/templates/coaches/detail.html` - Add former player section

**Dependencies:** US-P011 (Coach detail page), US-P004 (Player images)

### US-P016: Enhanced Birthplace Display with State/Province [NOT STARTED]
**Priority:** LOW
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Spec Reference:** UX enhancement request

**Description:**
Enhance the birthplace display on player and coach detail pages to include State/Province when the person was born in the United States or Canada.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] For players born in USA, display format: "City, State, USA" (e.g., "New York, NY, USA")
- [ ] For players born in Canada, display format: "City, Province, Canada" (e.g., "Toronto, ON, Canada")
- [ ] For all other countries, keep current format: "City, Country"
- [ ] Apply same logic to coach detail pages
- [ ] State/Province data sourced from cities.state_id field
- [ ] Only display state/province if data exists in database

**Technical Notes:**
- Cities table has state_id field linking to states table
- States table has state_id, nation_id, name, abbreviation columns
- Need to check if cities.state_id is populated for US/Canada cities
- May need to join: City → State → Nation to verify nation is USA/Canada
- Update player detail template (players/detail.html)
- Update coach detail template (coaches/detail.html)
- Consider adding state relationship to City model if not present

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Check if City model has state relationship defined
2. In player/coach detail routes, eager load city.state.nation
3. In templates, conditionally display state abbreviation for USA/Canada
4. Template logic: `{% if city.state and nation.name in ['United States', 'Canada'] %}{{ city.name }}, {{ state.abbreviation }}, {{ nation.abbreviation }}{% else %}{{ city.name }}, {{ nation.abbreviation }}{% endif %}`

**Data Validation Required:**
- Verify cities table has state_id populated for US/Canada cities
- Check states table for completeness (all 50 US states + Canadian provinces)
- Test with players from various countries to ensure proper display

**Dependencies:** None

### US-P017: Enhanced Draft Information Display [NOT STARTED]
**Priority:** LOW
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Spec Reference:** UX enhancement request

**Description:**
Enhance the draft information display on player detail pages to include the name of the team that drafted the player, providing better historical context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Draft field displays team name along with existing draft information
- [ ] Format: "YYYY - Round R, Pick P by Team Name" (e.g., "1984 - Round 2, Pick 188 by Detroit Tigers")
- [ ] Team name should be clickable link to team detail page
- [ ] Only display if player has draft information (many players are not drafted)
- [ ] Handle edge cases: undrafted players, international signees, etc.
- [ ] Apply to player detail page bio section

**Technical Notes:**
- Current draft data location needs investigation (likely players_core table or separate draft table)
- Fields likely include: draft_year, draft_round, draft_pick, draft_team_id
- Need to join with teams table to get team name
- Team relationship may need to be added to Player model
- Template location: `/web/app/templates/players/detail.html`

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Investigate draft data schema:
   - Check players_core table for draft-related columns
   - Check if separate draft_picks or draft_history table exists
   - Identify draft_team_id field (foreign key to teams table)

2. Update Player model (if needed):
   - Add draft_team relationship if not present
   - May need hybrid property for formatted draft display

3. Update player detail route:
   - Eager load draft_team relationship: `joinedload(Player.draft_team)`
   - Ensure draft_team is included in query options

4. Update player detail template:
   - Add team name to draft display
   - Make team name clickable: `<a href="{{ url_for('teams.team_detail', team_id=player.draft_team.team_id) }}">{{ player.draft_team.name }}</a>`
   - Example: `{{ player.draft_year }} - Round {{ player.draft_round }}, Pick {{ player.draft_pick }} by <a>{{ player.draft_team.name }}</a>`

**Data Validation Required:**
- Verify draft_team_id is populated in database
- Check for NULL values (undrafted players)
- Test with players from different draft eras
- Verify team_id references are valid (no broken foreign keys)

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
- Undrafted players: Display "Undrafted" or hide draft field entirely
- International signees: May have different acquisition method
- Players signed before draft era: Handle gracefully
- Team no longer exists (relocated/renamed): Still show historical team name

**Example Display Variations:**
- Drafted: "1984 - Round 2, Pick 188 by Detroit Tigers"
- Undrafted: "Undrafted Free Agent" or hide field
- First round: "1990 - Round 1, Pick 5 by New York Yankees"
- Supplemental round: "1988 - Supplemental Round, Pick 32 by Boston Red Sox" (if applicable)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test with high draft picks (Round 1)
- Test with late-round picks (Round 20+)
- Test with undrafted players
- Test with players on multiple teams (verify correct draft team shown)
- Test link to team detail page works

**Dependencies:** None

## Epic 2: Team Pages

### US-T001: Team Logo Display [DONE]
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 2-3 hours (actual: 1 hour)
**Status:** DONE
**Completed:** 2025-10-10
**Spec Reference:** Lines 43, 339

**Description:**
Display team logos on team pages with placeholder fallback.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Logo displayed on team home and team year pages
- [ ] Use team_logos table for logo paths
- [ ] Fallback placeholder for missing logos

---

### US-T002: Team Year Pages [DONE]
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 8-10 hours (actual: ~10 hours)
**Status:** DONE
**Spec Reference:** Lines 347-353, 375-387
**Completed:** 2025-10-10

**Description:**
Create team-year detail pages showing roster, stats, and results for a specific season.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] URL: `/teams/<team_id>/<year>`
- [x] Team logo and header
- [x] Previous/next year navigation
- [x] Team batting stats table (aggregate team stats)
- [x] Team pitching stats table (aggregate team stats)
- [x] Individual player batting stats table (all players with position column)
- [x] Individual player pitching stats table (all pitchers)
- [x] Top 12 players by WAR (with images)
- [x] Season record, place in standings

**Implementation Details:**

**Templates Created:**
- `/web/app/templates/teams/year.html` - Main team year page (206 lines)
- `/web/app/templates/teams/_roster_batting_table.html` - Individual player batting stats component (72 lines)
- `/web/app/templates/teams/_roster_pitching_table.html` - Individual player pitching stats component (74 lines)
- `/web/app/templates/teams/_top_players_grid.html` - Top 12 players grid with images (44 lines)

**Service Layer Functions:**
- `get_team_year_data(team_id, year)` - Retrieves team, record, batting/pitching aggregate stats
- `get_team_player_batting_stats(team_id, year)` - Individual player batting stats with position data
- `get_team_player_pitching_stats(team_id, year)` - Individual player pitching stats
- `get_team_top_players_by_war(team_id, year, limit)` - Top players by WAR (batting + pitching)
- `get_available_years_for_team(team_id)` - Years for prev/next navigation

**Features:**
- Handles both current year (1997) and historical years (1980-1996)
- Aggregate team batting/pitching stats displayed prominently
- Individual player stats tables with sortable columns (20 batting columns, 17 pitching columns)
- Top 12 players grid with player images and WAR values
- Previous/next year navigation with disabled states for missing years
- Responsive design with horizontal scroll for wide stat tables
- Sticky first column (player name) in roster tables

**Performance:**
- Query optimization implemented using SQLAlchemy `load_only()` and `raiseload()`
- Page load times: 0.3-0.5 seconds
- Minimal database queries (optimized service layer)

**Known Limitations:**
- **Position Data Workaround:** Currently sourcing player positions from `players_current_status` table (current position) instead of historical position data. This works for current/recent seasons but may be inaccurate for older historical data.
  - **Future Enhancement:** Once `players_career_fielding_stats` table is implemented, update `get_team_player_batting_stats()` in `team_service.py` to join with fielding stats instead of current status for accurate historical position data.
  - **Affected Files:** `/web/app/services/team_service.py` (lines 111-146)

**Dependencies:** US-T001 (Team logos - placeholder system in place)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/web/app/templates/teams/year.html` - Created
- `/web/app/templates/teams/_roster_batting_table.html` - Created
- `/web/app/templates/teams/_roster_pitching_table.html` - Created

### US-T002B: Remove Current Roster from Team Home & Add Current Year Link [DONE]
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 2-3 hours (actual: ~1 hour)
**Status:** DONE
**Completed:** 2025-10-10
**Spec Reference:** Follow-up to Session 4 performance optimization

**Description:**
Remove the simplified current roster table from the team home page and replace it with a prominent link to the current season's team-year page, which will show the full detailed roster.

**Context:**
During Session 4 performance optimization (US-T003), we switched the roster query to raw SQL to eliminate 1,849 cascading queries. This simplified roster now only shows: player name, position, bats, throws, birth city/nation. It lacks the rich detail that a proper roster should have (stats, jersey numbers, etc.).

Instead of maintaining two roster displays, we should:
1. Remove the simplified roster from team home page
2. Add a clear, prominent link to the current season team-year page
3. Ensure the current year team-year page has full roster details

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Remove roster section from `/web/app/templates/teams/detail.html`
- [x] Remove roster query from `/web/app/routes/teams.py` team_detail() route (lines ~90-135)
- [x] Remove `get_position_display()` helper function (no longer needed)
- [x] Add prominent "Current Season" or "1997 Season" button/card near top of team home page
- [x] Button links to `/teams/<team_id>/1997` (current year team-year page)
- [x] Ensure current year team-year page exists and displays full roster with stats
- [x] Update coaching staff section to remain on home page (coaches are current, not seasonal)
- [x] Test that navigation flow makes sense: Team Home → Current Year → Player details

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Button should be visually prominent (large, colored, clear call-to-action)
- Consider card/panel with current season stats preview: "1997 Season: 45-32, 2nd place"
- Position near top after franchise header, before franchise history sections
- Could include current W-L record, place in standings as teaser
- Mobile-friendly (works on small screens)

**Technical Notes:**
- This simplifies team home page and improves performance further (removes roster query entirely)
- Team-year pages already have infrastructure for detailed rosters (US-T002)
- Current year = 1997 (stored in CURRENT_GAME_YEAR constant in team_service.py)
- Team-year page should handle both historical years and current year seamlessly

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Removed from teams.py:**
   - Lines 20-26: `get_position_display()` helper function
   - Lines 93-145: Entire roster query (raw SQL + object conversion)
   - Removed `roster` from render_template context
   - Added `current_year=1997` to template context
   - Updated profiling step numbers (2→2, 3→3, etc.)

2. **Created Current Season Card (teams/detail.html lines 51-77):**
   - Large gradient blue card (from-blue-600 to-blue-800)
   - Left side: "1997 Season" heading with arrow CTA
   - Right side: Current W-L record, winning percentage, standings position
   - Full card is clickable link to `/teams/<team_id>/1997`
   - Hover effect (shadow-xl) for better UX
   - Positioned after team header, before coaching staff

3. **Removed from teams/detail.html:**
   - Lines 174-235: Entire "Active Roster" section with player table
   - Player images, names, positions, age, bats/throws, birthplace columns

**Performance Impact:**
- **ACTUAL:** Reduced team home page from 12 queries to 11 (removes roster query)
- **ACTUAL:** Reduced route execution time by ~12-15ms
- Simplified page complexity and maintenance burden

**Files Modified:**
- `/web/app/routes/teams.py` - Removed roster query, helper function, updated profiling
- `/web/app/templates/teams/detail.html` - Removed roster section, added current season card

**Testing:**
- ✅ Team home page loads: HTTP 200
- ✅ Current season card displays with correct link
- ✅ Roster section successfully removed (no "Active Roster" in HTML)
- ✅ Link to team-year page works: `/teams/1/1997` returns HTTP 200
- ✅ Coaching staff section remains on home page

**Dependencies:**
- US-T002 (Team Year Pages) - Complete and functional ✅
- US-T003 (Team Home Historical Summary) - Complete ✅

**Follow-up Tasks:**
- Consider adding "View Full Roster" links to other years in year-by-year table
- May want to add navigation breadcrumbs: Home > Teams > [Team Name] > [Year]

**Session 5 Completion Time:** ~1 hour (estimated 2-3 hours)

---

### US-T003: Team Home - Historical Summary [DONE]
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 6-8 hours (actual: ~10 hours including performance optimization)
**Status:** DONE
**Spec Reference:** Lines 339-345, 357-368
**Completed:** 2025-10-10 (Session 4)

**Description:**
Enhance team home page with franchise history, top players, year-by-year records.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Team logo top-left
- [x] H2: "$Team_nickname Team History & Encyclopedia"
- [x] Former team names (from team_history) - Deferred, data not available
- [x] Count of seasons
- [x] All-time W-L record
- [x] Playoff appearances count - Deferred, data not available
- [x] Championships count - Deferred, data not available
- [x] Top 24 franchise players by WAR (2x12 grid with images)
- [x] Year-by-year franchise table (all seasons)
- [ ] Organizational leaderboards links - Deferred until leaderboards exist

**Implementation Details:**
- Created comprehensive service layer in team_service.py:
  - `get_franchise_history()` - Aggregates all-time W-L from team_history tables
  - `get_franchise_top_players()` - CTE query for top 24 players by total WAR
  - `get_franchise_year_by_year()` - Year-by-year records with current season
- Template includes all franchise data sections
- Player grid component displays player cards with images

**Performance Optimization (Critical):**
This user story required extensive performance optimization work that became the focus of Session 4:

**Problem Discovered:**
- Initial implementation took 28+ seconds to load with 1,861 SQL queries
- Root cause: SQLAlchemy's `lazy='joined'` on models causing cascading eager loads
- Roster query alone generated 1,849 queries (Player → City → Nation → Continent cascade)
- `raiseload('*')` only blocks accessing relationships, not loading them

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Raw SQL for Roster Query** - Eliminated 1,849 cascading queries by bypassing ORM entirely
2. **Optimized Team Query** - Used load_only(), selectinload(), and nested raiseload('*')
3. **Service Layer Optimization** - Added raiseload('*') to all franchise service functions
4. **Helper Function** - Created get_position_display() for position code mapping

**Performance Results:**
- BEFORE: 28,000ms with 1,861 queries
- AFTER: 120ms with 12 queries
- **Improvement: 99.6% reduction in page load time (232x faster)**
- **Query reduction: 99.4% fewer queries**

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/web/app/services/team_service.py` - Added franchise service functions with optimization
- `/web/app/routes/teams.py` - Added raw SQL roster query, helper function, db import
- `/web/app/templates/teams/detail.html` - Integrated franchise history sections
- `/continuity.txt` - Documented Session 4 performance optimization journey

**Technical Highlights:**
- PostgreSQL CTE (WITH clause) for top players aggregation
- Partial indexes on stats tables (team_id, player_id WHERE split_id=1 AND war IS NOT NULL)
- Raw SQL with text() to completely bypass ORM relationship machinery
- Simple objects from dictionaries for template compatibility
- Nested raiseload('*') to prevent cascading through related models

**Key Learnings:**
- When models have `lazy='joined'`, SQLAlchemy loads relationships during query construction
- Only way to prevent cascading eager loads is to NOT use the ORM for these queries
- Raw SQL with text() is sometimes the only viable solution for complex relationship graphs
- Measuring query count is as important as measuring execution time

**Dependencies:** US-T001 (Team logos - done with placeholder system)

**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 8-10 hours (actual: ~4 hours)
**Status:** DONE
**Spec Reference:** Lines 100-163, 643-686
**Completed:** 2025-10-10

**Description:**
Build core leaderboard query infrastructure with caching and optimization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create leaderboard_service.py with reusable query functions
- [x] Implement materialized views for expensive aggregations
- [x] Set up caching strategy (Redis when available, in-memory for now)
- [x] Generic leaderboard query function with filters (stat, type, year, league)
- [x] Support for Career, Single-Season, Active leaderboards

**Technical Notes:**
- Critical for performance with 18+ seasons of data
- Use database indexes aggressively
- Consider pre-calculating common leaderboards in ETL

**Dependencies:** None (but Redis preferred)

**Implementation Notes (2025-10-10):**
1. **Materialized Views:** Leveraged existing 6 materialized views from ETL:
   - `leaderboard_career_batting` - Pre-aggregated career totals for all players
   - `leaderboard_career_pitching` - Pre-aggregated career pitching stats
   - `leaderboard_single_season_batting` - Best seasons (min 100 PA)
   - `leaderboard_single_season_pitching` - Best seasons (min 50 IP)
   - `leaderboard_yearly_batting` - Top 10 per year/league for key stats
   - `leaderboard_yearly_pitching` - Top 10 per year/league for key stats

2. **Created Leaderboard Models** (`/web/app/models/leaderboard.py`):
   - 6 read-only SQLAlchemy models mapping to materialized views
   - All include `is_active` flag for filtering active/retired players
   - Models use ReadOnlyMixin to prevent accidental writes

3. **Created Leaderboard Service** (`/web/app/services/leaderboard_service.py`):
   - **Career Leaders:** `get_career_batting_leaders()`, `get_career_pitching_leaders()`
   - **Single-Season Leaders:** `get_single_season_batting_leaders()`, `get_single_season_pitching_leaders()`
   - **Yearly League Leaders:** `get_yearly_batting_leaders()`, `get_yearly_pitching_leaders()`
   - **Helper Functions:** `get_top_level_leagues()`, `get_league_options()`, `get_available_years()`, `get_stat_metadata()`

4. **Filtering Capabilities:**
   - League filtering (top-level leagues only, as agreed)
   - Year filtering (single-season and yearly views)
   - Active/retired filtering (all views)
   - Stat-specific sorting (asc for ERA/WHIP, desc for all others)
   - Minimum qualification thresholds applied (1000 PA career, 500 IP career, 100 PA season, 50 IP season)

5. **Caching Strategy:**
   - In-memory cache with 15-minute TTL
   - Cache key generated from function name + parameters
   - `clear_cache()` function for manual cache invalidation
   - Ready for Redis integration (same interface)

6. **Performance Results (from test suite):**
   - Career batting leaders: 15-23ms
   - Career pitching leaders: 9-16ms
   - Single-season leaders: 15-18ms
   - Yearly league leaders: 5-7ms
   - Cache speedup: 537x faster (6.8ms → 0.01ms)
   - All queries well under target benchmark (<30ms, <2s for leaderboards)

**Files Created:**
- `/web/app/models/leaderboard.py` - 6 read-only models for materialized views
- `/web/app/services/leaderboard_service.py` - Complete service layer with caching
- `/test_leaderboards.py` - Comprehensive test suite (all tests passing)

**Files Modified:**
- `/web/app/models/__init__.py` - Added leaderboard model exports

**Test Coverage:**
- ✓ League options and filtering
- ✓ Career batting leaders (HR, AVG with PA threshold)
- ✓ Career pitching leaders (W, ERA with IP threshold)
- ✓ Single-season leaders (all-time and year-specific)
- ✓ Yearly league leaders (batting and pitching)
- ✓ Caching functionality and performance
- ✓ Stat metadata retrieval

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **League Filtering:** Top-level leagues only (league_level = 1). For career stats, uses subquery to find players with stats in target league
- **Universe Definition:** "All Leagues" includes all top-level leagues (not minors)
- **Qualification Thresholds:** Kept existing thresholds (100 PA, 50 IP single-season; 1000 PA, 500 IP career for rate stats)
- **View Enhancement:** Kept materialized views as-is, filter in application layer for league-specific career stats

### US-N004: Game Date Display in Header [NOT STARTED]
**Priority:** LOW
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Spec Reference:** UX enhancement request

**Description:**
Display the current game date prominently in the page header between the top navigation and search bar, giving users immediate context about the current in-game date.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Game date displayed on every page in the header
- [ ] Positioned between top navigation bar and search area
- [ ] Format: "Current Date: June 15, 1997" or similar readable format
- [ ] Sourced from league table's game_date field
- [ ] Centered or right-aligned for visibility
- [ ] Responsive design (works on mobile)
- [ ] No performance impact (should be cached or loaded once per page)

**Technical Notes:**
- Game date stored in leagues table (game_date column)
- Need to determine which league to use (likely league_id=1 or highest level league)
- Could cache this value since it changes infrequently
- Template location: `/web/app/templates/base.html`
- Add to context in base template or create context processor

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Create context processor in `/web/app/__init__.py` or `/web/app/context_processors.py`
2. Query: `League.query.filter_by(league_id=1).first().game_date` (or similar)
3. Add to Jinja2 global context: `{'current_game_date': game_date}`
4. Update base.html template to display between nav and search
5. Format date using strftime: `game_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y')`
6. Style with subtle background or border to make it visible but not intrusive

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Should be visible but not distracting
- Consider adding icon (calendar or clock)
- Could include season progress indicator (e.g., "Day 45 of 162")
- Match existing color scheme (blue/gray)
- Consider making it a link to a "Today's Games" or "Schedule" page (future enhancement)

**Example Implementation:**
```python
# In app/__init__.py or app/context_processors.py
@app.context_processor
def inject_game_date():
    from app.models import League
    league = League.query.filter_by(league_id=1).first()
    return {'current_game_date': league.game_date if league else None}
```

```html
<!-- In base.html between nav and search -->
<div class="bg-gray-100 border-b border-gray-300 py-2 text-center">
    <span class="text-sm text-gray-600">
        Current Date: <strong>{{ current_game_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y') }}</strong>
    </span>
</div>
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- Add to context processor (runs once per request)
- Consider caching with Redis (TTL: 1 hour) when available
- Query is simple and fast (single row, indexed primary key)

**Dependencies:** None (but benefits from US-I001 Redis caching)

---

## Epic 7: Infrastructure & Performance

### US-I001: Redis Caching Infrastructure [NOT STARTED]

---

### US-I002: Database Indexes [DONE]
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 2-4 hours (actual: ~2 hours)
**Status:** DONE
**Spec Reference:** Lines 741-752
**Completed:** 2025-10-09

**Description:**
Add critical database indexes for query performance on player detail page queries.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Analyzed current queries to identify missing indexes
- [x] Discovered most indexes already exist from ETL (batting_player_year, pitching_player_year, player names, etc.)
- [x] Added 20 indexes on trade_history player_id columns (player_id_0_0 through player_id_1_9)
- [x] Added 10 indexes on messages player_id columns (player_id_0 through player_id_9)
- [x] Used partial indexes with WHERE IS NOT NULL to optimize index size
- [x] Tested query performance before/after with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [x] Documented all indexes in DDL (etl/sql/tables/07_newspaper.sql)
- [x] Created migration script for existing databases (scripts/apply_performance_indexes.sql)

**Performance Improvements (EXPLAIN ANALYZE):**
- **Trade History Query** (player 16747, 4 trades):
  - BEFORE: 1.148ms (Sequential Scan of 2,097 rows)
  - AFTER: 0.667ms (Bitmap Index Scan using all 20 indexes)
  - **Improvement: 1.7x faster (42% reduction)**

- **Player News Query** (player 53425, 12 news stories):
  - BEFORE: 1.161ms (Bitmap Heap Scan filtering 1,819 rows)
  - AFTER: Expected similar improvement with BitmapOr on player indexes
  - Query now uses indexed lookups instead of filtering full result set

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Total Indexes Added: 30**
  - 20 on trade_history (all player_id slots)
  - 10 on messages (all player_id slots)
- Partial indexes with `WHERE column IS NOT NULL` to reduce index size
- PostgreSQL uses BitmapOr to combine multiple index scans efficiently
- ANALYZE run on both tables to update query planner statistics

**Files Modified:**
- `/etl/sql/tables/07_newspaper.sql` - Added index definitions to DDL
- `/scripts/apply_performance_indexes.sql` - Migration script for existing databases

**Scaling Notes:**
- Current improvements modest due to small table sizes (2,097 trades, 3,271 messages)
- Will scale much better as database grows (eliminates sequential scans)
- Bitmap index scans are O(log n) vs O(n) for sequential scans
- Future: Consider composite indexes for multi-column queries

### 2025-10-10 - Session 2: Coaches & Staff Implementation
**Context:**
Implemented complete coach pages and began team year pages work.

**Completed:**
- ✅ **US-P010:** Coach Model and Data Layer (3 hours actual)
- ✅ **US-P011:** Coach List and Detail Pages (4 hours actual)

- 🔧 **US-T002:** Team Year Pages (8 hours actual - core complete, roster/players pending)

**Implementation Details:**

**Coach Pages (Epic 1):**
1. **Coach Model** - Created with all 80+ fields, relationships, hybrid properties
   - Added occupation_display, occupation_sort_order properties
   - Labels: 7/8 = Base Coach (not generic "Staff")
   - Weight in lbs (not kg like originally thought)
2. **Coach Routes** - List grouped by occupation, detail with all sections
3. **Rating Bars** - Reusable macro, 0-200 scale, color-coded progression
4. **Preference Bars** - Reusable macro, -5 to +5 scale with marker positioning
5. **Images** - Served from `/etl/data/images/players/coach_{id}.png` (same directory as players!)
6. **Former Player Link** - Top-right corner shows player image with link when applicable

**Team Pages (Epic 2):**
1. **Team Logo Display** - Placeholder system (blue box with abbreviation) until logos available
2. **Team Coaching Staff** - Added to current team page with proper ordering:
   - Order: Owner → GM → Manager → Bench Coach → Pitching Coach → Hitting Coach → Base Coach → Scout → Trainer
   - Python sorting via occupation_sort_order property
3. **Team Year Pages** - Created infrastructure:
   - Models: TeamHistoryRecord, TeamHistoryBattingStats, TeamHistoryPitchingStats, TeamBattingStats, TeamPitchingStats
   - Service layer handles both historical (1980-1996) and current year (1997)
   - Route `/teams/<team_id>/<year>` with prev/next navigation
   - Template shows team batting/pitching stats, record, season info
   - TODO: Individual player roster, top 12 by WAR

**Bug Fixes:**
1. **OPS+ removed** - Not in database (no ETL calculation), removed from advanced batting table
2. **Coach weight** - Source data already in lbs, removed kg→lbs conversion
3. **Coach occupation ordering** - Created occupation_sort_order property, sorted in Python
4. **Coach images path** - Same directory as players: `/etl/data/images/players/coach_{id}.png`
5. **Nation abbreviation** - Used `nation.abbreviation` not `nation.abbr`

**Files Created:**
- `/web/app/models/coach.py` (200+ lines)
- `/web/app/models/team_history.py` (400+ lines, 5 models)
- `/web/app/services/team_service.py` (get_team_year_data, get_available_years_for_team)
- `/web/app/routes/coaches.py` (coach list, detail, image routes)
- `/web/app/templates/coaches/` (list, detail, _rating_bar, _preference_bar)
- `/web/app/templates/teams/_coaching_staff.html`
- `/web/app/templates/teams/_team_logo.html`
- `/web/app/templates/teams/year.html`

### 2025-10-10 - Session 4: Team Home Page Performance Optimization (COMPLETE)
**Context:**
Continued from Session 2, focused on completing US-T003 (Team Home - Historical Summary) which was implemented but had severe performance issues.

**Problem:**
- Team home page taking 28+ seconds to load with 1,861 SQL queries
- Page completely unusable in production
- Initial implementation complete but performance unacceptable

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. SQLAlchemy's `lazy='joined'` on models causing cascading eager loads
2. Roster query alone generated 1,849 queries (Player → City → Nation → Continent → State cascade)
3. Critical discovery: `raiseload('*')` only blocks **accessing** relationships, not **loading** them
4. When models have `lazy='joined'`, SQLAlchemy loads relationships during query construction time

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Raw SQL for Roster Query** - Switched from ORM to `text()` SQL to completely bypass relationship machinery
2. **Optimized Team Query** - Used `load_only()`, `selectinload()`, and nested `raiseload('*')`
3. **Service Layer Optimization** - Added `raiseload('*')` to all franchise service functions
4. **Helper Function** - Created `get_position_display()` for position code mapping

**Performance Results:**
```
BEFORE: 28,000ms with 1,861 queries
AFTER:    120ms with 12 queries

Improvement: 99.6% reduction (232x faster)
Query reduction: 99.4% fewer queries

Query breakdown:
- Get team: 80.2ms (5 queries)
- Get roster: 12.1ms (1 raw SQL query, 97 players) ← KEY FIX
- Get coaches: 9.5ms (1 query)
- Get franchise history: 5.7ms (2 queries)
- Get franchise top players: 7.6ms (1 CTE query)
- Get franchise year by year: 5.4ms (2 queries)
```

**Completed:**
- ✅ **US-T003:** Team Home - Historical Summary (with extensive performance optimization)
- ✅ Fixed critical performance bottleneck in team pages
- ✅ Documented optimization journey in continuity.txt
- ✅ Created reusable optimization patterns for future pages

**Key Learnings:**
- `lazy='joined'` in models loads relationships at query time, not access time
- Raw SQL with `text()` is sometimes the only viable solution for complex relationship graphs
- Measuring query count is as important as measuring execution time
- Always profile with real data before declaring optimization complete

**Files Modified:**
- `/web/app/routes/teams.py` - Added db import, helper function, raw SQL roster query
- `/web/app/services/team_service.py` - Added raiseload() to service functions
- `/continuity.txt` - Documented Session 4 journey
- `/docs/backlog.md` - Updated US-T003 with performance details

**Time Spent:** ~10 hours actual (investigation, implementation, testing, documentation)

**Follow-up Work Identified:**
- Created **US-T002B** to remove simplified roster from team home page
- Roster query optimization sacrificed detail for performance
- Better UX: Link to current year team-year page for full roster details
- Will further improve performance by removing roster query entirely (11 queries instead of 12)

**Status:**
✅ Session 4 complete - Team home pages now production-ready with sub-second load times
📋 New user story US-T002B added to backlog for roster cleanup
