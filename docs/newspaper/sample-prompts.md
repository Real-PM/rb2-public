HEADLINE: BRANCH SMASHES TWO HOMERS IN PILGRIMS VICTORY

Donovan Branch powered the Boston Pilgrims to a 5-3 victory over the Cleveland Roosters on Sunday with a spectacular two-home run performance at Fenway Park.

Branch went 3-for-4 with five runs batted in, connecting for solo shots in both the fourth and seventh innings. His offensive explosion helped the Pilgrims overcome an early deficit.

The 24-year-old outfielder's performance was particularly timely as Boston seeks to climb back into contention in the American League standings.
