# Phase 3 Completion Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Phase 3 (Editorial & User Input) of the newspaper implementation is **fully complete and tested**. All admin interfaces, user content creation, and public display pages are functional and ready for Phase 2 pipeline integration.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Models ✅

**File:** `/web/app/models/newspaper.py`

Created 5 SQLAlchemy models:
- `Article` - Main articles table with editorial workflow
- `ArticleCategory` - Article categorization
- `ArticlePlayerTag` - Junction table for player mentions
- `ArticleTeamTag` - Junction table for team mentions
- `ArticleGameTag` - Junction table for game recaps

**Key Features:**
- Editorial workflow: draft → published/rejected
- Version tracking: `generation_count` and `previous_version_id`
- Metadata: newsworthiness scores, AI model used, author type
- Relationships with players, teams, games

---

### 2. Admin Routes ✅

**File:** `/web/app/routes/newspaper_admin.py`

**Routes Created:**
- `GET /newspaper/admin/drafts` - List all draft articles
- `GET /newspaper/admin/review/<id>` - Review article with full metadata
- `POST /newspaper/admin/publish/<id>` - Publish a draft
- `POST /newspaper/admin/reject/<id>` - Reject a draft
- `POST /newspaper/admin/delete/<id>` - Delete a draft
- `GET/POST /newspaper/admin/regenerate/<id>` - Regenerate with feedback (ready for Phase 2)
- `GET/POST /newspaper/admin/create` - Manual article creation form
- `GET /newspaper/admin/api/players/search` - Player autocomplete
- `GET /newspaper/admin/api/teams/search` - Team autocomplete

**Authentication:**
- Development: Open access (no auth)
- Production: Documented Flask-Login implementation in `docs/newspaper/AUTHENTICATION-TODO.md`

---

### 3. Admin Templates ✅

**Location:** `/web/app/templates/newspaper/admin/`

**Templates:**
- `drafts.html` - Table view with scores, tags, actions
- `review.html` - Full article display with publish/regenerate/reject buttons
- `regenerate.html` - Feedback form for article regeneration
- `create.html` - Rich form with player/team autocomplete

**Design:**
- Follows `docs/newspaper/design-system.md` specifications
- Forest green, cream, tan, leather brown color palette
- Vintage newspaper aesthetic
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)

---

### 4. Public Routes ✅

**File:** `/web/app/routes/newspaper.py`

**Routes:**
- `GET /newspaper` - Homepage with hero article + grid
- `GET /newspaper/article/<slug>` - Individual article detail

**Features:**
- View counter increments on article view
- Related articles (same players)
- Auto-linking of player/team names (NEW!)

---

### 5. Public Templates ✅

**Location:** `/web/app/templates/newspaper/`

**Templates:**
- `index.html` - Newspaper masthead, hero article, 3-column grid
- `article.html` - Full article with featured players/teams, related articles

**Design:**
- "THE BRANCH BASEBALL GAZETTE" masthead
- Vintage newspaper date badges
- Era-appropriate bylines
- Article cards with tan borders

---

### 6. Auto-Linking Feature ✅ (NEW!)

**File:** `/web/app/utils/article_links.py`

**What It Does:**
Automatically converts player and team names in article content to clickable links.

**Example:**
```
Input: "Mike Branch hit two homers as the Red Sox beat Cleveland."
Output: "[Mike Branch](#) hit two homers as the [Red Sox](#) beat Cleveland."
         ↑ links to player page        ↑ links to team page
```

**Features:**
- Matches full names, last names, team nicknames
- Won't double-link existing HTML
- Case-insensitive, whole-word matching
- Processes longest names first (avoids partial matches)

**Functions:**
- `auto_link_content(content, player_tags, team_tags)` - Core linking logic
- `process_article_for_display(article)` - Helper for templates

---

### 7. Context Enhancements ✅

**Date Picker Default:**
- Article creation form now defaults to current game date (1965-09-01)
- Uses `current_game_date` from existing context processor
- No hardcoding - dynamically updates with simulation

## Bug Fixes

### Issue 1: Foreign Key Error with `games` Table
**Error:** `Foreign key associated with column 'newspaper_articles.game_id' could not find table 'games'`

**Cause:** SQLAlchemy ForeignKey declaration referencing undefined Game model

**Fix:** Removed `ForeignKey()` declarations from:
- `Article.game_id`
- `ArticleGameTag.game_id`

**Note:** Can be re-added when Game model is created

---

### Issue 2: SQLAlchemy Lambda Syntax Error
**Error:** `TypeError: <lambda>() missing 1 required positional argument: 'tag'`

**Location:** Related articles query in `newspaper.py`

**Fix:** Changed from:
```python
.filter(Article.player_tags.any(lambda tag: tag.player_id.in_(player_ids)))
```

To:
```python
.join(ArticlePlayerTag)
.filter(ArticlePlayerTag.player_id.in_(player_ids))
```

---

### Issue 3: Missing Template
**Error:** `TemplateNotFound: newspaper/admin/regenerate.html`

**Fix:** Created missing template with:
- Article preview
- Feedback textarea
- Model override dropdown
- Temperature slider
- Phase 2 integration note

---

## Ready for Phase 2 Integration

Phase 3 is complete and ready to receive articles from the Phase 2 pipeline:

### Integration Points:

1. **Article Generation** (Phase 2 Task 2.6)
   ```python
   # In etl/src/newspaper/pipeline.py
   from etl.src.newspaper.article_processor import ArticleProcessor

   processor = ArticleProcessor(db_connection)
   article_id = processor.process_and_save(
       raw_text=generated_article,
       game_id=game_id,
       generation_metadata={
           'model_used': 'qwen2.5:14b',
           'newsworthiness_score': 85
       },
       player_ids=[123, 456],
       team_ids=[10, 20]
   )
   # Article now appears in /newspaper/admin/drafts
   ```

2. **Article Regeneration** (Phase 2 Task 2.4)
   ```python
   # Called from newspaper_admin.py regenerate_article()
   from src.newspaper.pipeline import regenerate_article_with_feedback

   new_article_id = regenerate_article_with_feedback(
       article_id=article_id,
       feedback="Focus more on pitching performance",
       model_override="qwen2.5:14b",
       temperature=0.6
   )
   # New version appears in drafts with generation_count=2
   ```

---

## URLs for Testing

### Admin (Open Access - No Auth)
- http://localhost:5001/newspaper/admin/drafts
- http://localhost:5001/newspaper/admin/create

### Public
- http://localhost:5001/newspaper

## Authentication Security Notice

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Admin routes currently have **NO AUTHENTICATION**.

**For Production Deployment:**
1. Follow implementation guide: `docs/newspaper/AUTHENTICATION-TODO.md`
2. Install flask-login
3. Create User model with password hashing
4. Add login/logout routes
5. Replace `@admin_required` decorator with actual auth check
6. Set strong SECRET_KEY
7. Enable HTTPS and secure cookies

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours for full Flask-Login setup

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Game Model** - `game_id` stored as integer, no foreign key
   - Future: Create Game model and re-add ForeignKey declarations

2. **No Rich Text Editor** - Plain textarea for content
   - Future: Add TinyMCE or CKEditor

3. **No Image Support** - Text-only articles
   - Future: Add featured images

4. **Auto-Linking Limitations:**
   - Won't handle possessives ("Branch's") - need to add regex
   - May not catch all team name variations
   - Could be improved with more sophisticated NLP

5. **No Pagination** - Homepage shows max 20 articles
   - Future: Add pagination or infinite scroll

---

## Documentation Updated
