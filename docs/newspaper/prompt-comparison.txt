His key moments came in the 3rd, 6th, and 8th innings as he singled to left, right, and then delivered a go-ahead RBI double to left-center.

**Pilots Rally in 8th to Defeat Giants, 5-3**
*July 16, 1965*

The Seattle Pilots staged a dramatic eighth-inning rally to defeat the San Francisco Giants, 5-3, before a crowd of 15,234 at Candlestick Park on Friday night. The victory, highlighted by a clutch performance by center fielder Rickey Branch, lifted the Pilots to a 45-52 season mark.

After trailing, 2-1, following five innings, Seattle erupted for four runs in the eighth, capped by Branch's go-ahead RBI double to left-center field. The play, which scored Tommy Harper and Don Mincher, proved pivotal as the Pilots seized control. Branch, who went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and two runs scored, earlier contributed a sacrifice fly in the third and a single in the sixth.

Seattle's winning pitcher, Jim Bouton (8-5), held the Giants to three runs over seven innings, while reliever Diego Segui (12) earned his 12th save in the ninth. Conversely, Giants' starter Gaylord Perry (6-7) struggled, surrendering five runs on six hits in six innings.

The Pilots' offensive surge was fueled by Branch's timely hitting, particularly his eighth-inning double, which silenced the Candlestick Park crowd. "Rickey came through when we needed him most," said Pilots manager Bob Howsam. "That's the kind of leadership we need."

With the win, Seattle continues to battle for a playoff berth, while the Giants remain in a tight race with the rest of the National League.
