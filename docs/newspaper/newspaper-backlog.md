### Success Metrics

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Ollama running with 2+ models
- [ ] Database schema created
- [ ] ETL generates articles automatically
- [ ] Articles saved as drafts
- [ ] Editorial review functional
- [ ] Articles publish to homepage
- [ ] User can create manual articles

**Quality Metrics:**
- [ ] Generation success rate >90%
- [ ] Generation time <30s (8B), <60s (14B)
- [ ] Editorial rejection rate <20%
- [ ] Zero factual errors in articles

---

## Notes and Decisions

### Key Design Decisions
- **LLM Platform:** Ollama (local, cost-free, good performance)
- **Model Strategy:** Multi-tier (8B for routine, 14B/70B for important)
- **Workflow:** Draft-first with editorial review
- **Trigger:** Post-ETL automatic generation
- **Multi-Branch:** Single combined article

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should milestone articles use Claude API for highest quality?
- [ ] How to handle non-Branch milestone games (future)?
- [ ] Should we generate general game recaps (non-Branch)?
- [ ] What's the ideal prompt temperature (test in benchmarking)?

### Risks
- LLM hallucinations â†’ Mitigate with validation and review
- Slow generation â†’ Mitigate with model selection
- Poor quality â†’ Mitigate with prompt engineering
- game_logs.csv growth â†’ Mitigate with archival strategy
