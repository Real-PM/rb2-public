# Phase 1 Optimization Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Objective:** Improve web application performance through database indexing
**Result:** Performance degraded 3-25% - indexes alone insufficient

---

## What We Did

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Created `/etl/sql/indexes/` directory for index management
- ✅ Updated `SchemaManager` to auto-apply indexes during `init-db`
- ✅ Integrated indexes into deployment pipeline
- ✅ Set up browser-based performance measurement (Puppeteer)

### 2. Applied 13 Database Indexes

**Critical Foreign Keys:**
- player_status lookups (player_id, team_id, retired status)
- coaches by team

**Player Stats Optimization:**
- Composite indexes on batting/pitching stats with year ordering
- Partial indexes filtering split_id = 1 (regular season)

**Team & Standings:**
- Team relations, record, and history navigation
- League/division structure queries

### 3. Performance Measurement
- Baseline measurements: 7 pages × 3-7 runs each
- Post-index measurements: 3 batches × multiple pages
- Used real browser (Puppeteer) for accurate timings
- All data recorded in `docs/performance_baseline.csv`

## Results

| Page | Baseline | After Indexes | Change |
|------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Front Page | 3149ms | 3930ms | **+24.8% slower** |
| Player Detail | 3553ms | 4119ms | **+15.9% slower** |
| Coach Main | 8295ms | 8572ms | **+3.3% slower** |
| Team Main | 2009ms | 2156ms | **+7.3% slower** |
| Team Detail | 906ms | 893ms | -1.4% faster |

**Verdict:** Performance degraded on 4 of 5 pages tested.

## Index Usage Analysis

Queried `pg_stat_user_indexes` to verify index usage:

**Heavily Used (Good Investment):**
- `idx_player_status_player_id`: 3,007 scans ⭐
- `idx_pitching_stats_composite`: 354 scans
- `idx_batting_stats_composite`: 276 scans
- `idx_team_record_composite`: 72 scans
- `idx_coaches_team`: 27 scans

**Never Used (Wasted Overhead):**
- `idx_player_status_team_id`: 0 scans
- `idx_player_status_retired`: 0 scans
- `idx_team_relations_composite`: 0 scans
- `idx_teams_league_level`: 0 scans
- `idx_sub_leagues_composite`: 0 scans
- `idx_divisions_composite`: 0 scans
- `idx_team_history_composite`: 0 scans
- `idx_team_record_position`: 0 scans

## Why Performance Got Worse

### 1. **Index Overhead Without Benefit**
Unused indexes still incur maintenance costs during query execution. PostgreSQL must consider them in query planning even if not selected.

### 2. **Query Planner Confusion**
Multiple similar indexes can cause the query planner to choose suboptimal execution paths.

### 3. **Partial Index Mismatches**
Partial indexes with WHERE clauses only help if queries use the exact same filter. Our `WHERE retired = 0` index wasn't matching actual query patterns.

### 4. **Wrong Level of Optimization**
Database indexes can't fix application-level problems like:
- N+1 query patterns
- Cascade loading issues
- Inefficient ORM usage
- Excessive joins

### 5. **Assumption-Based Indexing**
We added indexes based on what we thought queries should be doing, not what they actually do.

---

## Key Learnings

### ❌ What Didn't Work
- Adding indexes without profiling actual queries first
- Partial indexes with WHERE clauses (too specific)
- Foreign key indexes on relationships not queried directly
- Indexes on tables the application doesn't query (team_relations, divisions)

### ✅ What Worked
- Composite indexes on heavily-queried player stats tables
- player_status_player_id index (3,007 scans!)
- INCLUDE clause on team_record for covering index
- Proper measurement methodology (real browser, multiple runs)

### 💡 Critical Insights
1. **Profile first, optimize second** - Must understand actual query patterns
2. **Application layer > Database layer** - N+1 queries kill performance regardless of indexes
3. **Measure everything** - pg_stat_user_indexes shows what's actually used
4. **Indexes have costs** - Unused indexes slow down queries
5. **Indexes persist** - Our indexes will now auto-apply in new environments via init-db

---

## Next Steps - Phase 1B

### Immediate Actions
1. **Drop unused indexes** to eliminate overhead
2. **Enable query logging** (SQLAlchemy echo mode)
3. **Profile critical routes** (Front page, Coach main)
4. **Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE** on slow queries

### Investigation Plan
```python
# Enable in development
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_ECHO'] = True

# Add Flask-DebugToolbar
pip install flask-debugtoolbar

# Profile specific routes
from flask import g
import time

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    g.start = time.time()

@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    diff = time.time() - g.start
    print(f"{request.path}: {diff*1000:.1f}ms")
    return response
```

### Focus Areas
1. **Coach Main page** (8.5s - slowest page)
2. **Front page** (+24.8% degradation)
3. **Player Detail** (3.5s+ consistently)

### Root Cause Analysis
Need to identify:
- Number of queries per page render
- N+1 query patterns
- Cascade loading issues
- Inefficient joins
- Missing eager loading

## Rollback Plan

If needed, drop all Phase 1 indexes:

```sql
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_player_status_player_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_player_status_team_id;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_player_status_retired;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_coaches_team;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_batting_stats_composite;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_pitching_stats_composite;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_team_relations_composite;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_team_record_composite;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_team_history_composite;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_teams_league_level;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_team_record_position;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_sub_leagues_composite;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_divisions_composite;
```

**Recommendation:** Keep only the heavily-used indexes:
- `idx_player_status_player_id` (3,007 scans)
- `idx_batting_stats_composite` (276 scans)
- `idx_pitching_stats_composite` (354 scans)
- `idx_team_record_composite` (72 scans)
- `idx_coaches_team` (27 scans)

---

## Conclusion

Phase 1 demonstrated that **database indexing without profiling is ineffective and can be counterproductive**. While we successfully integrated index management into the deployment pipeline, the performance results show we must:

1. **Understand the problem first** - Use profiling tools
2. **Fix application issues** - N+1 queries, cascade loading
3. **Add indexes strategically** - Based on actual query patterns
4. **Measure impact** - Keep what works, remove what doesn't

**Phase 1B Goal:** Achieve 30-50% performance improvement through query profiling and application-level optimization before adding any additional database indexes.
