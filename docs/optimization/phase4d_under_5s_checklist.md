# Phase 4D: Get Cold Loads Under 5 Seconds

**Goal:** Reduce player detail page cold loads from 60s to <5s
**Started:** 2025-10-23 Session 2
**Status:** 🟢 In Progress - Session 4 Complete (2025-10-24)

---

## Current Status (2025-10-24 Session 5 Complete)

| Page Type | Cold Load | Warm Load | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Player Detail | **74s** → **TBD** | **13ms** | ✅ Relationship cascading fixed - testing pending |
| Front Page | Unknown | Unknown | Untested |
| Team Detail | Unknown | Unknown | Untested |

**Session 5 Achievements:**
- ✅ **FOUND THE REAL BOTTLENECK!** Relationship cascading, not trades/messages queries
- ✅ Fixed massive cascading joins (Player→City→State→Nation→Continent)
- ✅ Changed `lazy='joined'` to `lazy='select'` for all geographic/team relationships
- ✅ Array storage implemented (migration 007) - ready for future use

**Critical Discovery:**
- Array storage (migration 007) implemented but **didn't improve performance**
- Trades/messages queries **weren't even being executed** during page load!
- Real bottleneck: **Relationship cascading** with 10+ LEFT OUTER JOIN queries
- SQLAlchemy warning: "Loader depth for query is excessively deep"
- **Solution:** Eliminated cascading joins by changing lazy loading strategy

---

## Session 5 Summary (2025-10-24) - BREAKTHROUGH! 🎯

### ✅ Completed This Session

1. **Array Storage Implementation (Migration 007)**
   - Added `all_player_ids INTEGER[]` columns to `trade_history` and `messages` tables
   - Created GIN indexes for fast array containment queries
   - Updated SQLAlchemy models with ARRAY columns
   - Updated service queries to use `.contains([player_id])`
   - Configured ETL to auto-populate arrays on future loads
   - **Result**: ❌ **NO performance improvement** - queries weren't the bottleneck!
   - Files: `etl/sql/migrations/007_array_storage_for_player_ids.sql`
   - Commits: Migration + model updates

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Deployed array storage to staging, tested player 1010
   - Cold load: **73.9 seconds** (no improvement from 62s baseline!)
   - Analyzed Flask application logs (`journalctl -u rb2-staging`)
   - **Critical finding**: trade_history and messages queries **not even executed** during page load
   - Discovered massive queries with 10+ LEFT OUTER JOINs loading cities, states, nations repeatedly
   - SQLAlchemy warning: "Loader depth for query is excessively deep; caching will be disabled"

3. **Identified Real Bottleneck: Relationship Cascading**
   - **Problem**: `lazy='joined'` on relationships creating deep cascade chains

   **Cascade Chain 1 (4 levels deep):**
   ```
   Player (lazy='joined') → City (lazy='joined') → State (lazy='joined') → Nation (lazy='joined') → Continent
   ```

   **Cascade Chain 2 (even deeper!):**
   ```
   Player (lazy='joined') → PlayerCurrentStatus (lazy='joined') → Team (lazy='joined') →
     ├─ City → State → Nation → Continent (4 more levels)
     ├─ Park → Nation → Continent
     ├─ Nation → Continent
     └─ League
   ```

   - This created **massive queries with 10+ table joins**
   - Same queries executed **5-6 times repeatedly**
   - Each query loading continents, nations, states, cities for every player lookup

4. **Solution: Fixed Relationship Loading**
   - Changed `lazy='joined'` to `lazy='select'` for all geographic and team relationships
   - **Files modified:**
     - `web/app/models/reference.py`: Nation.continent, State.nation, City.nation, City.state, Park.nation
     - `web/app/models/player.py`: Player.city_of_birth, Player.nation, Player.second_nation, PlayerCurrentStatus.team, PlayerCurrentStatus.league
     - `web/app/models/team.py`: Team.city, Team.park, Team.nation, Team.league, Team.record

   - **Impact:** Related objects now load on-demand with separate simple queries
   - SQLAlchemy identity map prevents duplicate queries
   - No more massive joins or deep cascading

   - Commit: `c97198f` - Fix relationship cascading bottleneck

### 🎯 Key Learnings

1. **Premature optimization**: We optimized the wrong thing (trades/messages queries)
2. **Array storage is correct**: Implementation is complete and will be useful when those queries ARE needed
3. **Real bottleneck was hidden**: Needed to analyze actual SQL queries in application logs
4. **Eager loading can cascade**: `lazy='joined'` on multiple levels creates exponential join complexity
5. **SQLAlchemy warnings matter**: "Loader depth excessively deep" was a critical clue
6. **Testing is essential**: Had to deploy to staging and analyze logs to find the real issue

### 📊 Expected Impact

**Before (Session 4):**
- Cold load: 74 seconds
- Massive queries: 10+ table joins repeated 5-6 times
- Relationship cascading: 4-7 levels deep

**After (Session 5):**
- Expected: <5 seconds (estimated 15x improvement)
- Simple queries: Single-table lookups with indexes
- Relationship loading: On-demand, only when accessed

**Next step:** Deploy to staging and measure actual performance

## Session 4 Summary (2025-10-24) - MAJOR PROGRESS

### ✅ Completed This Session

1. **Database Indexes Added**
   - Created comprehensive indexing for player detail queries
   - **Batting stats**: Composite index (player_id, split_id, level_id)
   - **Pitching stats**: Composite index (player_id, split_id, level_id)
   - **Trade history**: 20 partial indexes on player_id columns
   - **Result**: Queries now execute in <1ms (verified with EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
   - Files: `etl/sql/migrations/006_phase4d_player_detail_indexes.sql`
   - Commits: `4c39271`, `a6340d6`

2. **Index Verification**
   - EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows index usage and <1ms execution
   - Example: `SELECT * FROM players_career_batting_stats WHERE player_id=3000 AND split_id=1` = **0.121ms**
   - All queries using indexes correctly
   - **Surprising result**: Cold load still 62s despite fast queries!

3. **Threading Implementation Attempted**
   - Implemented ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel query execution
   - Used `@copy_current_request_context` for Flask context propagation
   - **Result**: 62s → 48s (only 23% improvement)
   - **Fatal flaw**: `DetachedInstanceError` - ORM objects detached from session
   - **Reverted**: Threading doesn't solve the problem
   - Commits: `865ba7e`, `96a3eac`, `03e31e2` (reverted)

4. **Root Cause Identified**
   - Queries are fast (<1ms each)
   - But 13 sequential queries with network round-trips = 62s
   - Bottleneck is **connection overhead + network latency**, NOT query execution
   - Database on different host (192.168.10.94) adds ~5s per round-trip

### 🎯 Key Learnings

1. **Indexes work perfectly**: All queries <1ms, using indexes correctly
2. **Query speed ≠ page speed**: Fast queries still slow if you have many sequential round-trips
3. **Threading doesn't help**: SQLAlchemy ORM objects can't cross thread boundaries safely
4. **Real bottleneck**: Network latency (13 queries × ~4.8s per round-trip ≈ 62s)
5. **Solution**: Reduce number of queries, not query speed

---

## Complete Optimization Strategy (Roadmap to <5s)

**Revised Strategy After Session 4:**
The bottleneck is **number of database round-trips**, not query speed. With network latency of ~4.8s per round-trip, we need to reduce from 13 queries to ≤2 queries to hit <5s.

### Phase 1: Lazy Loading (NEXT - Session 5)
**Target: 62s → 30s** (50% query reduction)
**Status:** Primary strategy - reduces queries from 13 to 7

#### 1.1 Minor League Stats (AJAX endpoint)
- Remove minor league queries from initial `player_detail()` load
- Create new route: `GET /players/<id>/minor-stats` (returns JSON)
- Add "Show Minor League Stats" button with AJAX handler
- **Impact:** Eliminates 4 queries (2 batting minor + 2 pitching minor)
- **Files:**
  - `web/app/routes/players.py` (remove 2 service calls, add new endpoint)
  - `web/app/templates/players/detail.html` (add button + JavaScript)

#### 1.2 Trade History Accordion (AJAX)
- Move trade history into collapsible accordion
- Load on first expand via AJAX
- Create route: `GET /players/<id>/trades` (returns JSON)
- **Impact:** Eliminates 1 expensive query with 20-way OR filter
- **Files:** Same as above

#### 1.3 Player News Accordion (AJAX)
- Move player news into collapsible accordion
- Load on first expand via AJAX
- Create route: `GET /players/<id>/news` (returns JSON)
- **Impact:** Eliminates 1 expensive query with 10-way OR filter
- **Files:** Same as above

**Total Phase 1 Impact:**
- Queries reduced: 13 → 7 (46% reduction)
- Estimated time: 60s → 30s

---

### Phase 2: Query Consolidation (Session 6)
**Target: 30s → 10-15s** (further reduce query count)
**Status:** ~~Threading reverted (DetachedInstanceError)~~ - New approach needed

#### 2.1 Consolidate Stats Queries
Instead of 4 separate stats queries, fetch all stats in one call:

```python
# Current (4 queries):
batting_major = get_player_career_batting_stats(player_id, league_level=1)
batting_minor = get_player_career_batting_stats(player_id, league_level=2)
pitching_major = get_player_career_pitching_stats(player_id, league_level=1)
pitching_minor = get_player_career_pitching_stats(player_id, league_level=2)

# Proposed (1 query):
all_stats = get_player_all_stats(player_id)  # Returns all batting + pitching for all levels
# Split results in Python
```

**Implementation:**
- Single raw SQL query with UNION ALL to fetch all stats
- Process results in Python to split by sport/level
- Return dictionary with all four datasets

**Impact:** 4 queries → 1 query = 3 fewer round-trips (~14s saved)

**Files:**
- `web/app/services/player_service.py` (new function: `get_player_all_stats`)
- `web/app/routes/players.py` (call single function instead of 4)

---

### Phase 3: Database Indexes
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Session 4)
**Result:** All queries now execute in <1ms

#### 3.1 Indexes Added
All recommended indexes have been created and verified:
```sql
-- For batting/pitching stats queries
CREATE INDEX idx_batting_player_split ON players_batting(player_id, split_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_batting_player_league ON players_batting(player_id, league_level);
CREATE INDEX idx_pitching_player_split ON players_pitching(player_id, split_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_pitching_player_league ON players_pitching(player_id, league_level);

-- For trade history (temporary - see Phase 4)
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_player_0_0 ON trades_history(player_id_0_0) WHERE player_id_0_0 IS NOT NULL;
-- Repeat for all 20 player_id columns...

-- For messages (temporary - see Phase 4)
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_player_type ON messages(player_id_0, message_type, deleted);
-- Repeat for all 10 player_id columns...
```

**Impact:** Could reduce individual query times by 50-80% if indexes are missing

---

### Phase 4: Array Storage for Trades/Messages (Future - Separate Task)
**Target: Long-term query performance** 🌟 **BIGGEST WIN**

#### 4.1 Problem
Current schema has 20 separate columns for player IDs in trades:
```python
WHERE player_id_0_0 = X OR player_id_0_1 = X OR ... OR player_id_1_9 = X  # Slow!
```

#### 4.2 Solution: PostgreSQL Array Columns
```sql
-- Add array columns
ALTER TABLE trades_history ADD COLUMN all_player_ids INTEGER[];
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN all_player_ids INTEGER[];

-- Create GIN indexes for fast array containment
CREATE INDEX idx_trades_all_players_gin ON trades_history USING GIN (all_player_ids);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_all_players_gin ON messages USING GIN (all_player_ids);
```

Query becomes:
```python
# Single array containment check (fast with GIN index!)
TradeHistory.query.filter(TradeHistory.all_player_ids.contains([player_id]))
```

#### 4.3 Implementation Plan
1. **ETL Changes** (preprocessing):
   ```python
   # When processing trades CSV:
   trade_record = {
       'all_player_ids': [pid for pid in [
           player_id_0_0, player_id_0_1, ..., player_id_1_9
       ] if pid is not None]
   }
   ```

2. **Database Migration:**
   - Add array columns (keep old columns for safety)
   - One-time data migration: populate arrays from existing columns
   - Update queries to use array containment
   - Verify performance improvement
   - Drop old columns after verification

3. **Query Updates:**
   ```python
   # In player_service.py
   from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ARRAY

   def get_player_trade_history(player_id):
       return TradeHistory.query.filter(
           TradeHistory.all_player_ids.contains([player_id])
       ).all()
   ```

**Impact:** Query time could reduce from ~5-10s to <100ms with GIN index

**Files:**
- `etl/src/loaders/` - Add array column population
- `web/app/models/` - Add array column definitions
- `web/app/services/player_service.py` - Update queries
- `scripts/migrations/` - Create migration script

**Status:** 📋 Planned - Requires separate task/session

## Technical Implementation Details

### Manual Caching Implementation

**Location:** `web/app/routes/players.py:143-285`

```python
@bp.route('/<int:player_id>')
def player_detail(player_id):
    """Player detail page - bio, stats, ratings

    OPTIMIZATION: Manual caching implemented due to Flask-Caching
    decorator issues with dynamic key_prefix.
    """
    # Manual cache check
    cache_key = f'player_detail:{player_id}'
    cached_data = cache.get(cache_key)

    if cached_data is not None:
        return cached_data

    # ... load all data, render template ...

    # Cache the rendered HTML
    cache.set(cache_key, rendered_html, timeout=600)

    return rendered_html
```

**Cache Key Format:**
- Raw key: `player_detail:{player_id}` (e.g., `player_detail:3000`)
- Redis key: `rb2_staging:player_detail:3000` (with CACHE_KEY_PREFIX)

**Cache Storage:**
- Content: Full rendered HTML string
- Timeout: 600s (10 minutes)
- Type: String (Redis)

### DictToObject Helper Class

**Location:** `web/app/routes/players.py:13-35`

```python
class DictToObject:
    """Convert dict to object with attribute access for template compatibility

    Handles key name aliasing for template compatibility:
    - 'avg' -> 'batting_average'
    - 'obp' -> 'on_base_percentage'
    - 'slg' -> 'slugging_percentage'
    """
    def __init__(self, d):
        # First, update dict normally
        self.__dict__.update(d)

        # Then add aliases for short key names
        if 'avg' in d:
            self.batting_average = d['avg']
        if 'obp' in d:
            self.on_base_percentage = d['obp']
        if 'slg' in d:
            self.slugging_percentage = d['slg']
        if 'ops' in d and not hasattr(self, 'ops'):
            self.ops = d['ops']
```

**Purpose:** Service layer returns dicts (performance), templates expect objects (Jinja2 dot notation)

**Key Aliasing:** Service uses inconsistent naming:
- Yearly stats: Short keys ('avg', 'obp', 'slg')
- Career totals: Long keys ('batting_average', 'on_base_percentage', 'slugging_percentage')
- Templates: Expect long keys (from original ORM attributes)

---

## Database Query Analysis (Pending)

**Current queries in `player_detail()` route:**
1. Main player bio query (~1-2 queries with selectinload)
2. `get_player_career_batting_stats(player_id, league_level=1)` - 2 queries
3. `get_player_career_batting_stats(player_id, league_level=2)` - 2 queries
4. `get_player_career_pitching_stats(player_id, league_level=1)` - 2 queries
5. `get_player_career_pitching_stats(player_id, league_level=2)` - 2 queries
6. `get_player_trade_history(player_id)` - 1 query (20-way OR filter!)
7. `get_player_news(player_id)` - 1 query (10-way OR filter!)

**Total: ~12-13 queries**

**Expensive queries identified:**
- Trade history: 20-column OR filter
- Player news: 10-column OR filter
- Both excellent candidates for lazy loading + eventual array storage

**Index check required:** Awaiting staging query results to identify missing indexes

# Clear cache and test
docker exec $(docker ps --filter name=redis -q) redis-cli -n 1 FLUSHDB
echo "=== COLD LOAD ==="
time curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:5002/players/3000
echo "=== CACHE KEYS ==="
docker exec $(docker ps --filter name=redis -q) redis-cli -n 1 KEYS '*player_detail*'
echo "=== WARM LOAD ==="
time curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:5002/players/3000
```

SELECT tablename, indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('players_batting', 'players_pitching', 'trades_history', 'messages')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
"
```

## Session 5 Deep Dive: Relationship Cascading Problem

### The Investigation

After implementing array storage (migration 007) and seeing **no performance improvement**, we analyzed the Flask application logs to understand what was actually happening during the 74-second page load.

### What We Found

**The Smoking Gun:**
```
SQLAlchemy warning: "Loader depth for query is excessively deep; caching will be disabled"
```

Looking at the actual SQL queries in `journalctl -u rb2-staging`:
- Massive queries with **10+ LEFT OUTER JOINs**
- Same queries repeated **5-6 times**
- Loading cities, states, nations, continents repeatedly
- **NO queries to trade_history or messages tables!**

### The Root Cause

The problem was `lazy='joined'` creating deep cascading relationship chains:

**Example Query Generated:**
```sql
SELECT players_core.*, cities.*, states.*, nations.*, continents.*,
       players_current_status.*, teams.*, teams_cities.*, teams_states.*, teams_nations.*,
       parks.*, parks_nations.*, leagues.*
FROM players_core
LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON players_core.city_of_birth_id = cities.city_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN states ON cities.state_id = states.state_id AND cities.nation_id = states.nation_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN nations ON states.nation_id = nations.nation_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN continents ON nations.continent_id = continents.continent_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN players_current_status ON players_core.player_id = players_current_status.player_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN teams ON players_current_status.team_id = teams.team_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN cities AS teams_cities ON teams.city_id = teams_cities.city_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN states AS teams_states ON teams_cities.state_id = teams_states.state_id
-- ... and so on for 10+ tables
WHERE players_core.player_id = 1010;
```

This massive query was executed multiple times during a single page load!

### The Solution

Changed all geographic and team relationships from `lazy='joined'` to `lazy='select'`:

**Before:**
```python
# Player model
city_of_birth = db.relationship('City', lazy='joined')
nation = db.relationship('Nation', lazy='joined')

# City model
state = db.relationship('State', lazy='joined')
nation = db.relationship('Nation', lazy='joined')

# State model
nation = db.relationship('Nation', lazy='joined')

# Nation model
continent = db.relationship('Continent', lazy='joined')
```

**After:**
```python
# All changed to lazy='select'
city_of_birth = db.relationship('City', lazy='select')
nation = db.relationship('Nation', lazy='select')
state = db.relationship('State', lazy='select')
continent = db.relationship('Continent', lazy='select')
```

### Why This Works

With `lazy='select'`:
1. Related objects are loaded **only when accessed** in Python code
2. Separate, simple queries are executed for each relationship:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM players_core WHERE player_id = 1010;
   -- Only if template accesses player.city_of_birth:
   SELECT * FROM cities WHERE city_id = 123;
   -- Only if template accesses city.state:
   SELECT * FROM states WHERE state_id = 45 AND nation_id = 1;
   ```
3. SQLAlchemy's identity map prevents duplicate queries
4. Each query uses indexes and executes in <1ms
5. No massive joins, no deep cascading

### Lessons Learned

1. **Eager loading isn't always better**: `lazy='joined'` seems like a good idea (fewer queries), but can create massive joins
2. **Cascading matters**: 4+ levels of `lazy='joined'` creates exponential complexity
3. **Test with real data**: The bottleneck was invisible until we analyzed production logs
4. **SQLAlchemy warnings are critical**: "Loader depth excessively deep" was the key clue
5. **Optimize the right thing**: We spent time on array storage when the real issue was relationship loading

### Array Storage Status

Migration 007 is **complete and correct**:
- ✅ `all_player_ids` columns added to trade_history and messages
- ✅ GIN indexes created for fast array containment
- ✅ SQLAlchemy models updated
- ✅ Service queries updated to use `.contains([player_id])`
- ✅ ETL configured to auto-populate on future loads

**Status:** Ready for use when trades/messages queries ARE needed (currently not executed during page load)

---

## Next Session Priorities (Session 6)

**Primary Goal:** Deploy relationship cascading fixes and verify performance

**Why This Should Work:**
- ✅ Eliminated massive 10+ table joins
- ✅ Queries now simple and use indexes (<1ms each)
- ✅ No more deep relationship cascading
- ✅ SQLAlchemy identity map prevents duplicate queries

**Expected Result:** 74s → <5s (15x improvement)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Deploy to staging server:**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/rb2-public
   git pull origin master
   sudo systemctl restart rb2-staging
   ```

2. **Clear cache and test:**
   ```bash
   docker exec $(docker ps --filter name=redis -q) redis-cli -n 1 FLUSHDB
   ```

3. **Measure cold load:**
   ```bash
   time curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:5002/players/1010
   ```

4. **Analyze queries (if still slow):**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u rb2-staging -n 200 --no-pager | grep "SELECT"
   ```

5. **If successful (<5s):**
   - Tag version: `v0.3.0-phase4d-relationship-fix`
   - Update documentation with actual measurements
   - Close Phase 4D optimization task

6. **If still slow (>5s):**
   - Analyze remaining bottlenecks
   - Consider AJAX lazy loading for minor league stats (Phase 1 strategy)
   - Consider query consolidation (Phase 2 strategy)
