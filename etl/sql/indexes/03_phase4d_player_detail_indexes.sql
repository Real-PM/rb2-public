-- Phase 4D: Player Detail Page Performance Indexes
-- Created: 2025-10-24
-- Purpose: Add critical indexes for player detail page queries
-- Expected Impact: 60s â†’ 10-15s cold load (80-85% improvement)
--
-- This file is included in database initialization and will persist across
-- environment refreshes. See migration/006_phase4d_player_detail_indexes.sql
-- for the full migration script with detailed documentation.

-- BATTING STATS INDEXES
-- =============================================================================

-- Composite index for player + split + level (most efficient)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_batting_player_split_level
ON players_career_batting_stats(player_id, split_id, level_id);

-- Individual indexes for partial query coverage
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_batting_player_split
ON players_career_batting_stats(player_id, split_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_batting_player_level
ON players_career_batting_stats(player_id, level_id);

-- Partial index for regular season (split_id=1) - most common query
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_batting_player_regular_season
ON players_career_batting_stats(player_id, level_id)
WHERE split_id = 1;

-- =============================================================================
-- PITCHING STATS INDEXES
-- =============================================================================

-- Composite index for player + split + level (most efficient)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_pitching_player_split_level
ON players_career_pitching_stats(player_id, split_id, level_id);

-- Individual indexes for partial query coverage

-- TRADE HISTORY INDEXES

-- Note: These will be replaced with a single GIN array index in Phase 4
-- when array storage is implemented for player IDs.
